## (1) The Nevada Geothermal Machine Learning Project

### GBCGE project personnel: 
Dr. James Faulds (PI); Dr. Bridget Ayling; Elijah Mlawsky; Dr. Cary Lindsey; Connor Smith; Dr. Mark Coolbaugh

### Project collaborators: 
United States Geological Survey; Hi-Q Geophysical; Massachusetts Institute of Technology

### Project duration: 
24 months: 1 August 2019 – 28 February 2022.

### Total project funding: 
$500,000

### Funding agency: 
U.S. Department of Energy Geothermal Technologies Office (award number DE-EE0008762).

### Project goal:
 Apply machine learning (ML) techniques to develop an algorithmic approach to identify new geothermal systems in the Great Basin region and build on the successes of the Nevada geothermal play fairway project. The reason for this is that an algorithmic approach that empirically learns to estimate weights of influence for diverse parameters may scale and perform better than the original workflow developed for play fairway analysis. Project activities include augmenting the number of training sites (positive and negative) that are needed to train the ML algorithms, transforming the data into formats suitable for ML, and development and testing of the ML techniques and outputs.

### Project duration: 
4.5 years: 1 February 2021 – 30 June 2025.

### Total project funding: 
$10,000,000

### Funding agency: 
U.S. Department of Energy Geothermal Technologies Office (award number DE-EE0009254 ).

### Project goal: 
The primary goal of this project is to accelerate discoveries of new, commercially viable hidden geothermal systems while reducing the exploration and development risks for all geothermal resources. We stand at a major crossroads in geothermal research and development, whereby major achievements have been made in PFA, 3D and conceptual modeling, resource capacity estimation, ML, the application of advanced geostatistics, and value of information (VOI) analysis, but these techniques have yet to be combined into one over-arching best-practices workflow for a broad region. Our ambitious project proposes to fully integrate these techniques to develop a comprehensive exploration workflow toolkit that includes predictive geothermal PF maps at both the regional- and prospect-scale, detailed 3D maps and conceptual models, and a developers’ playbook. Building on geothermal play fairway (PF) efforts in central Nevada, NE California/NW Nevada, and western Utah, we will expand these study areas to the broader Great Basin region for early stage prospect identification. Concurrently, we will move several blind prospects forward with detailed geological and geophysical analyses followed by drilling thermal-gradient holes (TGH) and possibly slimholes.
